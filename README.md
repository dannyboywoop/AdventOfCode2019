# AdventOfCode2019
Repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

## My goal

My goal is to create two solutions for each problem.
* One in **Python** - My best attempt at a "neat" solution.
* One in **Ada** - Using more features than is probably necessary, to learn the language.

As this will be my first time coding in Ada, I expect the early problems to have some *questionable* solutions. Hopefully this will improve as I go on.
